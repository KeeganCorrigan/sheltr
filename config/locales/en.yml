# Files in the config/locales directory are used for internationalization
# and are automatically loaded by Rails. If you want to use locales other
# than English, add the necessary files in this directory.
#
# To use the locales, use `I18n.t`:
#
#     I18n.t 'hello'
#
# In views, this is aliased to just `t`:
#
#     <%= t('hello') %>
#
# To use a different locale, set it with `I18n.locale`:
#
#     I18n.locale = :es
#
# This would use the information in config/locales/es.yml.
#
# The following keys must be escaped otherwise they will not be retrieved by
# the default I18n backend:
#
# true, false, on, off, yes, no
#
# Instead, surround them with single quotes.
#
# en:
#   'true': 'foo'
#
# To learn more, please read the Rails Internationalization guide
# available at http://guides.rubyonrails.org/i18n.html.

      info_1: "Sheltr is meant to connect people who need help with resources. Currently, you can search for shelters, places to spend the day, free food, and mental health help."
      info_2: Sheltr is intended to be easy to use, responsive, and intuitive. Not everyone knows how to navigate dense menus, and hopefully Sheltr can help.
      info_3: "There are around <strong>500,000</strong> homeless in the United States. Almost <strong>20%</strong> of the population lives below the poverty line (less than <strong>$23,000 a year for a family of 4</strong>). If you're interested in helping, volunteer at a local shelter, donate clothing or hygiene items, or donate money."
